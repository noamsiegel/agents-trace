# Changelog

## [0.1.0] — initial public release

### Added
- CLI subcommands: `collect`, `sessions-since`, `gist-create`, `pr-attach`, `scrub-rules`.
- Time-overlap session scoping with configurable grace (`--grace-min`).
- 15+ default scrubbers covering common token families (GitHub PAT, AWS, GCP, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, JWT, private-key blocks, DB URLs with basic auth, emails, home paths).
- Shell-wrapper recipes for `gh pr create` and `gt submit` (in README).
- bun-test suite (8 tests) covering CLI dispatch, scrubber rules, session detection, slash-command filtering, and unsafe-file rejection.

### Security
- **C1**: refuses to attach to public-repo PRs by default. Detects visibility via `gh repo view --json visibility`. Override with `--public-ok` after dry-run review.
- **C2**: transcript content is treated as untrusted — markdown links/images flattened to plain text, HTML tags stripped, content wrapped in fenced code blocks labeled untrusted, fence-escape attempts neutralized.
- **C3**: JSONL reads use `lstat`+`fstat` to reject symlinks, hardlinks (`nlink > 1`), non-regular files, files not owned by current uid, and files larger than 20MB. Row count capped at 50000.
- **Hard gitleaks gate**: refuses to post on any gitleaks finding unless `--force`. No soft-confirmation path.
- Defense-in-depth scrubbers run BEFORE gitleaks.

### Known limitations
- macOS-tested. Linux probably works but untested in CI.
- bun runtime required. (Bun ships as a single binary; install via `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`.)
- Default scoping is time-overlap only. File-overlap (intersecting with PR diff) planned for next release.

### Not in this release
- Subagent context handoff (`provenance handoff`).
- File-overlap session scoping.
- ETag-based PR-body concurrency for force-push re-attach.
- Custom YAML scrubber rules in `~/.config/provenance/config.yaml`.
